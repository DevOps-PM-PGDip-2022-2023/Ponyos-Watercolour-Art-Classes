# Tenants of Design
The code framework to be used will be <<>>, we will be programming using the IDE << >>

# Security:
- << >>: uses static analysis to find bugs in code. 
 
- <<>>.

# Testing:

The quality of the application will be assessed through three main testing types as defined below.

- Unit Test - For better code coverage, code will be written with the unit test. The developer will be responsible for writing the unit test. These unit tests will be used in our pipeline to achieve our CI approach.

- Functional Test: The test engineer will conduct functional testing via automated test scripts created through the Playwrite automation tool for UI (black box testing). The Regression pack will be created via a subset of the Automated test suite. This regression pack will be utilized in the Pipeline before the deployment stage to achieve our CD approach. Also, a tester will assess the scope of API test and write API automation tests in Postman(if required) 

- Exploratory Test: Along with UI and API tests, the tester will perform an Exploratory test to make sure the non-functional aspects of the application like responsiveness, usability, etc

    
# Environments:
    staging and production
    tight configuration management for consistency and reproducibility
